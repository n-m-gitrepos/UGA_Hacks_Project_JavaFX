Project Details: 

  The project is designed by employing Java & JavaFX concepts predominantly, while IntelliJ serving as a common IDE to code in. It's primary objective is to generate QR Codes based off of user's choice of input and preferences. Users can select any common website they desire or search result they are trying to reach which will be accessed through a familiar search engine like google.com. The QR Code is crafted to be versatile providing any size or color that the user may prefer. The program's intricate design choice not only makes it a useful program involving aesthetics but also prioritizes user experience and user engagement. By avoiding basic black boxes, the QR Code steers away from functional representation and refelects on individual requests. In essence, the project's use of Java & JavaFX focuses on accessibility and inclusivity of the users making the process of interacting with QR Codes simple yet effective. We ran in to different issues over the course of creating this project. The first problem we encountered was figuring out the layout of the user interface while also keeping the functionality of the application. Another issue was combining the different Java libraries in order to seamlessly integrate them, including the API, saving/copying the files, and exception handling. In order to collaborate, we utilized Git. Even though we were relatively inexperienced with Git and GitHub, especially towards the beginning, we worked through all the different commands like merge, branch, pull, and push. We all became very efficient with using Git. One more issue was debugging. We underestimated the plethora of issues regarding debugging using JavaFX.
